Newton Gravity Discovery Game is an **interactive web experience** that playfully recreate the legendary moment of Newton's gravity discovery. As a students we have to learn _Gravity and Motions Law_ stuffs in your syllabus which is annoying sometime. So I create this short game for fun and visalualization.

### How to Play ðŸŽ®
Click on **Apple** or **Rock** to make them fall on **Newton** and let the consequences happens...

The game features beautiful visuals, dynamic animations, and a fun, educational twistâ€”perfect for students, science enthusiasts, or anyone who loves creative browser games.

> If you find this game **funny** please give it a start ðŸŒŸ

### About this game development
This is a simple react app with containing a single `newton-app\src\NewtonAppleGame.jsx` file beside base setup code and also some images and music. That's it a simple react app.
